For Example: 'Field 1' == 'Value 1'. For single control characters (' \\/) to be skipped, you can use \\. For example: Field1 == I\\'m. Also you can combine multiple conditions. For Example: F1 == V1 || F1 == V2. Normally all operators are interpreted from left to right. You can change the order by placing brackets. For Example: F1 == V1 && ( F2 == V2 || F2 == V3 ). Also you can search text fields using regex: F1 == /Tes.*/i",
